### Environment setup

Cosmos runs only on Linux systems. We have tested the installation with Ubuntu 24.04, 22.04, and 20.04.
Cosmos requires the Python version to be `3.10.x`. Please also make sure you have `conda` installed ([instructions](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)).

The below commands creates the `lyra` conda environment and installs the dependencies for inference:
```bash
# Create the lyra conda environment.
conda env create --file lyra.yaml
# Activate the lyra conda environment.
conda activate lyra
# Install the dependencies.
pip install -r requirements_gen3c.txt
pip install -r requirements_lyra.txt
# NOTE: If the ln -sf commands below fail silently, try running the above pip installs again first.
# Patch Transformer engine linking issues in conda environments.
ln -sf $CONDA_PREFIX/lib/python3.10/site-packages/nvidia/*/include/* $CONDA_PREFIX/include/
ln -sf $CONDA_PREFIX/lib/python3.10/site-packages/nvidia/*/include/* $CONDA_PREFIX/include/python3.10
# Install Transformer engine.
pip install transformer-engine[pytorch]==1.12.0
# Install Apex for inference.
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex
CUDA_HOME=$CONDA_PREFIX pip install -v --disable-pip-version-check --no-cache-dir --no-build-isolation --config-settings "--build-option=--cpp_ext" --config-settings "--build-option=--cuda_ext" ./apex
# Install MoGe for inference.
pip install git+.
pip install --no-buildYou can test the environment setup for with:
```bash
CUDA_HOME=$CONDA_PREFIX PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python scripts/test_environment.py
```

 **Note (personal):** On my machine the `ln -sf` glob commands occasionally fail silently if the nvidia packages aren't fully installed yet. Running `pip install -r requirements_lyra.txt` a second time before those lines resolved it.

 **Note (personal):** When building Apex, the compilation can take 20–30 minutes on my machine. Adding `-j$(nproc)` to the pip install command did not help here since it's controlled by the build backend, but making sure no other GPU processes are running during the build seemed to reduce occasional CUDA OOM errors mid-compile.

### Download Cosmos-Predict1 tokenizer

1. Generate a [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) access token (if you haven't done so already). Set the access token to `Read` permission (default is `Fine-grained`).

2. Log in to Hugging Face with the access token:
   ```bash
   huggingface-cli login
   ```

3. Download the Cosmos Tokenize model weights from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/collections/nvidia/cosmos-predict1-67c9d1b97678dbf7669c89a7):
```bash
python3 -m scripts.download_tokenizer_checkpoints --checkpoint_dir checkpoints/cosmos_predict1 --tokenizer_types CV8x8x8-720p
```

The downloaded files should be in the following structure:
```
checkpoints/
├── Cosmos-Tokenize1-CV8x8x8-720p
├── Cosmos-Tokenize1-DV8x16x16-720p
├── Cosmos-Tokenize1-CI8x8-360p
├── Cosmos-Tokenize1-CI16x16-360p
├── Cosmos-Tokenize1-CV4x8x8-360p
├── Cosmos-Tokenize1-DI8x8-360p
├── Cosmos-Tokenize1-DI16x16-360p
└── Cosmos-Tokenize1-DV4x8x8-360p
```

Under the checkpoint repository `checkpoints/<model-name>`, we provide the encoder, decoder, the full autoencoder in TorchScript (PyTorch JIT mode) and the native PyTorch checkpoints. For insta
